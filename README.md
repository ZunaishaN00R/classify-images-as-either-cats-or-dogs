# Cat vs. Dogs Image Classification

Overview
# Overview
This repository presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed using TensorFlow and Keras for the binary classification task of discerning between images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on the Cats vs. Dogs dataset, featuring 25,000 labeled images equally distributed between the two classes.

Dataset
# Dataset
The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, encompasses a diverse collection of images, and it has been split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Model Architecture
# Model Architecture
The neural network architecture adheres to a standard CNN structure, incorporating layers such as Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) serves as the activation function throughout the model. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, binary crossentropy loss (ideal for binary classification), and accuracy as the evaluation metric.

Data Augmentation
To bolster the model's robustness, data augmentation is applied during training through the utilization of the ImageDataGenerator from Keras. This includes transformative operations such as rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping.

Training and Evaluation
The model undergoes training on the designated training set for 10 epochs, and its performance is subsequently assessed on the testing set. The training history, encompassing accuracy and loss for both training and validation phases, is meticulously recorded for comprehensive analysis.

Results
The model exhibits effective learning, as evidenced by the ascending trend in both training and validation accuracy over epochs. Notably, the validation accuracy attains an 85% threshold, signifying the model's adeptness in generalizing to previously unseen data.

Conclusion
This project furnishes a foundational example of image classification using a CNN tailored for the Cats vs. Dogs dataset. The attained accuracy underscores the model's proficiency in distinguishing between these two classes. Further refinement or exploration of advanced architectures holds the potential for even more promising results.
